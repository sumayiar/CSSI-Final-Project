# CSSI-Final-Project

Wind down at the Virtual Cafe and get some studying done! 

As students, we can get easily overwhelmed with the various tasks life throws at us. That's why the Virtual Cafe will only let you jot down three tasks to focus on. How amazing! When you're done with one task, you can delete that task and add another one.

If you want some relaxing tunes, we have lofi playlists from Spotify that is catered each of our five wonderous themes: Cafe, City, Beach, Forest, and Library.

Use the Pomodoro timer for a structured routine and avoid distractions. It's more helpful than you think!

We also implemented a live clock to help you keep track of the time while you study away! Good luck fellow students!
